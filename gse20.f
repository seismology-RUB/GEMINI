c The following code is provided by
c Urs Kradolfer (Swiss Seismological Service).
c
c It is taken from packages related to the GSE2.0 file format.
c 
c We use the following routines:
c DIF1       calculates first differences (compress)
c REMDIF1    remove first differences (decompress)
c CMPRS6     compress integer data in a six bit ascii character scheme
c DCOMP6     unpack character scheme to reveal the integer data
c INTAND     do a bitwise AND operation
c 
c These routines are not ment to be called directly.

c#    The following data compression and decompression routines have
c#    been developped by Dr. Shane Ingate and Dr. Ken Muirhead, at the
c#    Australian Seismological Centre, Bureau of Mineral Resources,
c#    Canberra, Australia.
c#    They provided me with these routines in March 1989 during the
c#    session of the Group of Scientific Experts (GSE) in Geneva.
c#    These compression/decompression algorithms are used by all members
c#    of the GSE during the large-scale data exchange experiment GSETT-2,
c#    carried out from 1989 to 1991.
c#    It is recommended to use second differences and the six-bit compression.
c#    The second differences can be computed by two subsequent calls of
c#    subroutine DIF1 (see above).
c#    These routines are already running on many different machines.
c#    Because the AND function is not standard FORTRAN 77, this operation
c#    has been moved to a separate subroutine INTAND. All users of these
c#    routines will have to modify INTAND so that it performs correctly on
c#    their computers.
