Program package FLGEVASK and FLMODES:
=====================================

A program package to calculate Green functions and normal modes
in a depth-dependent 1D spherical or plane earth model. Can be used from
continental scale calculations down to seam waves if epicentral
distances, penetration depth and max frequency scale appropriately.
Tested frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1200 Hz.

Requirements:
----------------

- f2c, gcc and gfortran for compilation
- GNU make
- m4 macro processor

Compilation:
-------------
Use Makefile Make.green for compiling the Green function codes:

* touch *.m4
* make -f Make.green flgevask
* make -f Make.green seismogram
* make -f Make.green greenseis

Use Makefile Make.modes for compiling the normal mode code:

* touch *.m4
* make -f Make.modes flmodes

Use Makefile Make.f90 to compile Fortran 90 code:

* make -f Make.f90 modeseis
* make -f Make.f90 plotFldispersion
* make -f Make.f90 plotFlmodes

The m4 macro processor is used to automatically generate code needed for either
flgevask or flmodes from a common template.

Usage:
--------
The code is self-explaining. Just enter the name of the executable and you get a
description of arguments and options. For theoretical background look into the
documentation or into the paper by Friederich and Dalkolmo (GJI, 1995).

Info file:  all information about source and receiver is provided by an info file.

flgevask:   calculate frequency-wavenumber spectra for the displacement stress vector (DSV)
            with components U, R, V, S, W, T
seismogram: calculate synthetic seismograms (takes stations from info file, components selected from command line)
greenseis:  calculate synthetic seismograms (takes stations and components from info file)

flmodes:    calculate eigen-wavenumbers and eigenfunctions
modeseis:   calculate synthetic seismograms (takes stations and components from info file, use f90 code)

Seismogram format:
------------------
The output format for the synthetics is SFF (Stuttgart File Format) which is a slight modification of GSE2.0
with CMPR6 compression. The routines gse20.f, stuff.f and sunfortran.c contain a library of functions
to read and write SFF files. As far as I know SFF files can be read in using Seismic Handler. Look into
stuff.f for a detailed description of the available functions.
